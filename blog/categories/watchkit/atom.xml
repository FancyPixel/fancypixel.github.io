    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago we released Gulps on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gulps/id979057304?ls=1&amp;mt=8">AppStore</a>. Gulps is a simple water tracking app that also reminds you when to drink throughout the day.<br/>
This was an app of &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; for me: first Swift app, first full app open sourced, first WatchKit app, first HealthKit app, first 3D touch implementation. It&rsquo;s my go-to app when I need to experiment with new stuff. The streak continues with WatchOS 2.<br/>
In this post we&rsquo;ll cover how to share data between the main app and the watch extension with the WatchConnectivity framework, and how to create a simple set of watch face complications. As an added bonus we&rsquo;ll be doing that with a full open source app, that&rsquo;s live on the AppStore. Off we go.</p>

<h2>Gulps</h2>

<p>The previous version of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gulps/id979057304?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Gulps</a> relied on Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionScenarios.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH21-SW1">App grouping</a> to share data between the app and the watch extension. The data was stored on <a href="http://ream.io">Realm</a>, and thanks to its notification system, the watch app was always kept up to date when a change occurred. This was possible because the watch extension used to live on the phone alongside the main app. It was a brilliant system, and so easy to implement&hellip; my heart sank when Apple announced that they were moving the watch extension on the watch itself. I knew that a storm of refactoring was coming. Before opening that can of worms, let&rsquo;s reminisce about the good old times.<br/>
This is the setup for a WatchOS 1 app:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">realmToken = RLMRealm.defaultRealm().addNotificationBlock { note, realm in
    self.reloadAndUpdateUI()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once a change occurred on the phone or on the Watch app, a broadcast notification was fired, triggering a closure that updated the UI. <br/>
If you want to know more about Realm and app grouping, checkout <a href="http://fancypixel.github.io/blog/2015/03/29/share-data-between-watchkit-and-your-app-with-realm/">this article</a> by yours truly. It still is the best way to share data between the main app and an extension (e.g: a today widget).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-11-24/gulps.png" width="500" title="&lsquo;Gulps&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>WatchOS 2</h2>

<p>I do realize it took me a while to jump on the WatchOS 2 train, but since Gulps was fairly good received and reviewed, I wanted to be extra careful in handling the transition to the new OS. Just as a reminder, WatchOS 2 drastically changes how a watch app works, by moving the extension from the iPhone app to the Apple Watch itself.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-11-24/architecture.png" width="500" title="&lsquo;WatchOS 2&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This has a major advantages: less spinning spinner of spinning boredom, the app is a lot snappier, and can rely a lot less on the phone (e.g. by making independent network requests).<br/>
That&rsquo;s cool, but it comes at a cost&hellip; sharing data as we did before is impossible.
Apple provided a new framework though: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/WatchConnectivity/Reference/WatchConnectivity_framework/index.html">WatchConnectivity</a>.</p>

<p>The framework offers different ways to enable the communication between the phone and the watch, but it can be really tricky to get everything working reliably.
We can say that WatchOS 2 added some complexity and some complications 😬.<br/>
Complications are small modules used to personalize the watch faces and show small tidbits of interesting data when the user glances at the time. Now we can finally add our own modules, and having the percentage of your daily water intake goal sounds pretty good (so good that users started to request them the day after WatchOS 2&rsquo;s release).</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>

<p><code>WatchConnectivity</code> introduces four main ways to communicate between the phone and watch:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Application Context</em>, a dictionary with the latest up to date information. It&rsquo;s transferred by the system in the background, and each new entry overwrites the old one. This is great to share the application current state</li>
<li><em>Use info</em>, similar to the application context, but the transfers are queued up and delivered in order, without overwrites</li>
<li><em>File transfer</em> to share files</li>
<li><em>Interactive messages</em>, used when both the app and the phone are active and in range. It&rsquo;s a more interactive way to share data, ideal when the user needs to see the feedback on both screens.</li>
</ul>


<p>For Gulps I picked <em>Application Context</em> sharing, since the current state of the daily progress is what really matters, and the user hardly uses both apps at the same time (although since the transfer is pretty fast, when he does, the feedback is still snappy).<br/>
All the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/FancyPixel/gulps">GitHub</a>, for sharing the data we&rsquo;ll reference the <code>WatchConnectivityHelper</code> and <code>WatchEntryHelper</code>: <a href="https://github.com/FancyPixel/gulps/blob/master/Gulps/Support/WatchConnectivityHelper.swift">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FancyPixel/gulps/blob/master/Gulps%20WatchKit%20Extension/WatchEntryHelper.swift">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Setting up the session</h3>

<p>Before communicating back and forth we need to enable the watch session on both the phone and the watch. We do this using <code>WatchConnectivity</code>&rsquo;s singleton <code>WCSession</code>.<br/>
The session must be initiated as soon as possible, so the <code>AppDelegate</code> sounds like a reasonable place to to that on the phone counterpart:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">public func setupWatchConnectivity(delegate delegate: WCSessionDelegate) {
    guard WCSession.isSupported() else {
        return
    }

    let session = WCSession.defaultSession()
    session.delegate = delegate
    session.activateSession()
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>WCSessionDelegate</code> protocol declares all the functions that can be triggered by the session. We only need to implement this one if we are interested in the application context, though:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func session(session: WCSession, didReceiveApplicationContext applicationContext: [String : AnyObject])
</code></pre>

<p>As the signature suggests, this is fired when there is an update in the application context, and the second parameter is the context itself, represented by a dictionary. We&rsquo;ll cover this later.</p>

<p>Once the phone is set up we need to do pretty much the same on the watch side. A good place to initiate the session on the watch is in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/WatchKit/Reference/WKExtensionDelegate_protocol/index.html">watch extension delegate</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func applicationDidFinishLaunching() {
    setupWatchConnectivity()
}

// MARK: - Watch Connectivity

private func setupWatchConnectivity() {
    guard WCSession.isSupported() else {
        return
    }

    let session  = WCSession.defaultSession()
    session.delegate = self
    session.activateSession()
}
</code></pre>

<p>All set up, time to think about how to communicate.</p>

<h3>From phone to watch</h3>

<p>All the utility functions to send and read data from the watch are held in a handy struct: <code>WatchConnectivityHelper</code>, and an instance of this struct is held by the <code>AppDelegate</code>. We need a way to be notified when a change occurs on our database, so that we can trigger an update to the application context. As I mentioned before, Realm makes this pretty easy, thanks to <a href="https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#notifications">Realm Notifications</a>. Soon after the session is set a new Realm notification is created (the token needs to be strongly held):</p>

<pre><code class="swift">realmNotification = watchConnectivityHelper.setupWatchUpdates()
</code></pre>

<p><code>setupWatchUpdates</code> implementation is straightforward:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">/**
 Updates data on WatchOS, and listens for changes
 - Returns: RLMNotificationToken that needs to be retained
 */
public func setupWatchUpdates() -&gt; RLMNotificationToken {
    // Send the current data right away
    sendWatchData()
    return EntryHandler.sharedHandler.realm.addNotificationBlock { note, realm in
        // Once a change in Realm is triggered, refresh the watch data
        self.sendWatchData()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This opportunistically sends the current status right away, and creates a new token that, once a change is triggered, calls again the method that sends the application context.</p>

<p>This is a good time to think about what we really need on the watch, and model our application context accordingly. We want to keep the data transfer at a minimum to avoid lengthy transfer times, while having all what we need at hand.
For my purpose all I need is the current user status, his daily goal and his portion sizes (they might change over time, so they need to be refreshed often).</p>

<pre><code class="swift">public class func watchData(current current: Double) -&gt; [String: Double] {
    let userDefaults = NSUserDefaults.groupUserDefaults()
    return [
        Constants.Gulp.Goal.key(): userDefaults.doubleForKey(Constants.Gulp.Goal.key()),
        Constants.WatchContext.Current.key(): current,
        Constants.Gulp.Small.key(): userDefaults.doubleForKey(Constants.Gulp.Small.key()),
        Constants.Gulp.Big.key(): userDefaults.doubleForKey(Constants.Gulp.Big.key())]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once the data packet is ready we can shoot it to the watch:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">/**
 Sends the current data to WatchOS
 */
public func sendWatchData() {
    guard WCSession.isSupported() else {
        return
    }

    let watchData = Settings.watchData(current: EntryHandler.sharedHandler.currentEntry().quantity)
    let session = WCSession.defaultSession()
    session.activateSession()
    if session.watchAppInstalled {
        do {
            try session.updateApplicationContext(watchData)
        } catch {
            print("Unable to send application context: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To send the new context we need to make sure that the watch app is in fact installed, and then we call <code>updateApplicationContext(_:)</code>, function that might throw, so it needs to be called with <code>try</code>.</p>

<p>On the watch end we need to wait for a <code>WCSessionDelegate</code> call and store the new stuff:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func session(session: WCSession, didReceiveApplicationContext applicationContext: [String : AnyObject]) {
    if let goal = applicationContext[Constants.Gulp.Goal.key()] as? Double,
        let current = applicationContext[Constants.WatchContext.Current.key()] as? Double,
        let small = applicationContext[Constants.Gulp.Small.key()] as? Double,
        let big = applicationContext[Constants.Gulp.Big.key()] as? Double {
            WatchEntryHelper.sharedHelper.saveSettings(goal: goal, current: current, small: small, big: big)
            NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().postNotificationName(NotificationContextReceived, object: nil)
            self.reloadComplications()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since we are implementing all this in the Extension delegate, to update the interface (in the off chance that the user is staring at both his phone and watch with both apps running) we toss a notification through the <code>NSNotificationCenter</code>, letting the interface controller handle that with an animation. Another approach would be to force a reload of the interface controller, but that would prevent such animation.</p>

<p>Luckily the communication between watch and phone works pretty much the same way.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that once the application context updates I also reload the complications, let&rsquo;s talk about that.</p>

<h2>Life is not that complicated</h2>

<p>Complications are elements that live on the watch face and can be customized by the user. There are different kinds of complications with different sizes, depending on the space that they are displayed on. These are the possible complication families that we can implement:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-11-24/complications.png" width="500" title="&lsquo;Complications&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Complications are provided by a single object that implements the <code>CLKComplicationDataSource</code> protocol. This object is declared straight in the watch app&rsquo;s Info.plist file, and gets loaded automatically by the system.<br/>
A single complication can offer a static snapshot of the current situation (the current temperature, your activity data, or in Gulp&rsquo;s case the current daily goal&rsquo;s completion rate), and it also can offer time travel features, allowing the user to nudge the digital crown to have a past or future snapshot. Time travel is great for apps that already know the future, but won&rsquo;t fit the bill with Gulps, so you won&rsquo;t see its implementation here. If you want to learn more, jump to the end of this post for a bunch of references.</p>

<h3>CLKComplicationDataSource</h3>

<p>In our case the datasource methods that need an implementation are these two:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func getPlaceholderTemplateForComplication(complication: CLKComplication, withHandler handler: (CLKComplicationTemplate?) -&gt; Void)
func getCurrentTimelineEntryForComplication(complication: CLKComplication, withHandler handler: (CLKComplicationTimelineEntry?) -&gt; Void)
</code></pre>

<p>The first function requests a template for a given complication type. A template is a simple static placeholder that is shown to the user while he&rsquo;s configuring the watch face. The second function requests the current complication that needs to be loaded. They both require you to call a completion handler with the correct object for each complication you support. You declare the support to a given complication type in the project&rsquo;s settings.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-11-24/settings.png" width="500" title="&lsquo;Settings&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the templates:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func getPlaceholderTemplateForComplication(complication: CLKComplication, withHandler handler: (CLKComplicationTemplate?) -&gt; Void) {
    if complication.family == .UtilitarianSmall {
        let smallFlat = CLKComplicationTemplateUtilitarianSmallFlat()
        smallFlat.textProvider = CLKSimpleTextProvider(text: "42%")
        smallFlat.imageProvider = CLKImageProvider(onePieceImage: UIImage(named: "complication")!)
        smallFlat.tintColor = .mainColor()
        handler(smallFlat)
    } 
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty mundane bit of code, we check which complication family was requested, and we provide one. Complications have many settings and preset types, so I encourage you to check Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/ClockKit/Reference/ClockKit_framework/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016082">reference guide</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-11-24/template.png" width="300" title="&lsquo;Template&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The final complication setup doesn&rsquo;t differ too much from the template, beside the obvious current value that replaces the pre baked placeholder:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func getCurrentTimelineEntryForComplication(complication: CLKComplication, withHandler handler: (CLKComplicationTimelineEntry?) -&gt; Void) {
    let percentage = WatchEntryHelper.sharedHelper.percentage() ?? 0

    if complication.family == .UtilitarianSmall {
        let smallFlat = CLKComplicationTemplateUtilitarianSmallFlat()
        smallFlat.textProvider = CLKSimpleTextProvider(text: "\(percentage)%")
        smallFlat.imageProvider = CLKImageProvider(onePieceImage: UIImage(named: "complication")!)
        smallFlat.tintColor = .mainColor()
        handler(CLKComplicationTimelineEntry(date: NSDate(), complicationTemplate: smallFlat))
    } 
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Check out the full source <a href="https://github.com/FancyPixel/gulps/blob/master/Gulps%20WatchKit%20Extension/ComplicationController.swift">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Reloading complications</h3>

<p>So, the user fills his progress, goes to sleep, picks up the watch in the morning and&hellip; there it is&hellip; his previous percentage still showing.<br/>
Finding a way to reset the percentage wasn&rsquo;t that straightforward, since I&rsquo;m only refreshing the complications when a new portion is added.</p>

<p>As it turns out though, the data source protocol holds a pretty handy function:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">/** This method will be called when you are woken due to a requested update. If your complication data has changed you can
 then call -reloadTimelineForComplication: or -extendTimelineForComplication: to trigger an update. */
optional public func requestedUpdateDidBegin()
</code></pre>

<p>A-ha! WatchOS asks your complications how they are feeling every once in a while&hellip; so kind of him. We can use this opportunity to reset the complications:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func requestedUpdateDidBegin() {
    let server = CLKComplicationServer.sharedInstance()

    server.activeComplications.forEach { server.reloadTimelineForComplication($0) }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since the model holds the date of the last update, it&rsquo;s easy to check when a percentage is stale:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">/**
 Returns the current quantity
 It also checks if the data is stale, resetting the quantity if needed
 - Returns: Double the current quantity
 */
func quantity() -&gt; Double {
    let quantity = userDefaults.doubleForKey(Constants.WatchContext.Current.key())

    if let date = userDefaults.objectForKey(Constants.WatchContext.Date.key()) as? NSDate {
        if let tomorrow = date.startOfTomorrow where NSDate().compare(tomorrow) != NSComparisonResult.OrderedAscending {
            // Data is stale, reset the counter
            return 0
        }
    }

    return quantity
}
</code></pre>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-11-24/thereitis.gif" width="400" title="&lsquo;Jeff&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You can head to the <a href="https://github.com/FancyPixel/gulps">GitHub repo</a> of Gulps and compile it, or even better download it from the store, and you&rsquo;ll notice that the WatchOS app is a lot snappier, and the communication time between the two devices is pretty fast.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it, but it required a good dose of patience. <code>WatchConnectivity</code> works great when you are learning it with a simple demo app, but once you factor in an app just a little bit more complex, you&rsquo;re in for a treat. In the end it all boils down to figuring out what <em>needs</em> to be transfered and <em>when</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t help that getting the app compiled on a real device requires quite a lot time. You&rsquo;ll be seeing the <a href="https://twitter.com/theandreamazz/status/658968255349063682">loading spinner</a> A LOT, soldier on.<br/>
With that being said, in the end the app runs way smoother, so it&rsquo;s all worth it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a busy year for iOS developers. We got a slew of new toys to play with: a new version of iOS, new frameworks, a new language, new screen sizes and some new hardware to put on our wrists, just as soon as we thought that watches were anachronistic.<br/>
New technology is always exciting, but keeping up to date can be a daunting task when deadlines keep getting closer. Lately I&rsquo;ve been taking some time off to delve deeper in these new topics and build a simple app out of it (that we are planning to open source). At the time of this writeup the app is still waiting to be reviewed, so we&rsquo;re going to just focus on something that I learned in the process and that can be useful to a lot of other iOS devs: sharing data between your app and its WatchKit extension, using <a href="http://realm.io/">Realm</a>.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h1>Why Realm</h1>

<p>Realm is a great replacement for both SQLite and Core Data, it offers a quick and painless way to persist data in your iOS (and Android) app. The thing that makes it so great is the ease of use, it reduces your boilerplate code to next to nothing (I&rsquo;m watching you, Core Data), keeping things at a high level of abstraction (I&rsquo;m watching you SQLite) and&hellip; it&rsquo;s fast. It really is a brilliant piece of software, and I urge you to checkout the <a href="http://realm.io/docs/cocoa/0.91.1/">official documentation</a> if you&rsquo;re in need of a persistence framework for your app.</p>

<h1>The sample app</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to learn how to share data between an app and its WatchKit extension, and what better way to use a sample app as reference?.
I&rsquo;m not a fan of TODO app demos, they always feel&hellip; unimaginative&hellip; but I have to admit that they are the perfect sample for a task like this. So, bear with me, let me introduce to you another TODO sample app: <em>Done!</em>, a simple TODO list where we can add items and mark them as done from our Apple Watch.</p>

<h1>Setting up Realm</h1>

<p>WatchKit extensions are just another target inside your app, just like Today extensions, so they are packed alongside your app, but they have their own life, and most importantly, their own bundle identifier. This means that data stored within an app is not visible to the extension and vice versa. Apple offers a way to solve the issue through app groups.<br/>
App groups, like bundle identifiers, are defined by a reverse URI and they are prefixed with <code>group.</code>. They let you share data between your apps and are tightly bound to your provisioning profile (luckily Xcode handles their creation in your developer portal with ease).<br/>
We can take advantage of that to create our Realm database in a shared space that will be visible (and writeable) by both our app and the app&rsquo;s WatchKit extension. Let&rsquo;s start by creating the group in our project&rsquo;s capabilities section:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-03-29/appgroup.png" width="640" height="150" title="&lsquo;App groups&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Once this is out of the way we can tell Realm to store the database inside the group.
We&rsquo;ll do so in our AppDelegate&rsquo;s <code>application(application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:)</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>let directory: NSURL = NSFileManager.defaultManager().containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier("group.it.fancypixel.Done")!
let realmPath = directory.path!.stringByAppendingPathComponent("db.realm")
RLMRealm.setDefaultRealmPath(realmPath)
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, Realm is ready to go, we just need to define a model to persist. Let&rsquo;s do it:</p>

<pre><code>// Entry.swift
import Realm

class Entry: RLMObject {
  dynamic var title = ""
  dynamic var completed = false
}
</code></pre>

<h1>ViewController</h1>

<p>The ViewController handling the TODO list will be rather simple, it&rsquo;ll hold a plain <code>UITableView</code> with a custom header presenting the <code>UITextField</code> for the user&rsquo;s input, nothing fancy:</p>

<pre><code>// ViewController.swift
import Realm
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource, UITextFieldDelegate {

    @IBOutlet var tableView: UITableView!
    var dataSource: RLMResults!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        reloadEntries()

</code></pre>

<p>As you can see we are retrieving the table view&rsquo;s items from Realm with a simple call:</p>

<pre><code>Entry.allObjects()
</code></pre>

<p>and storing the changes with a couple of lines:</p>

<pre><code>realm.beginWriteTransaction()
let entry = Entry
entry.title = textField.text
entry.completed = false
realm.addObject(entry)
realm.commitWriteTransaction()
</code></pre>

<p>If you worked with Core Data in the past you should have a better understanding of my claim <em>&ldquo;less boilerplate code&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<h1>WatchKit</h1>

<p>Ok, new technology, new framework, so much to learn, right?<br/>
Well, it turns out that Apple did some thinking on this, and for what I witnessed, developing a Watch app is going to feel familiar for a lot of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch developers, albeit with some significant philosophical changes. First things first, let&rsquo;s create a new target holding the Watch app:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-03-29/newtarget.png" width="640" height="340" title="&lsquo;WatchKit target&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Then, the layout. We won&rsquo;t be using Autolayout, but something reminiscing a simplified version of Android&rsquo;s linear and relative layouts (no need to touch beefy XML files though, storyboards are still there for us). The layout for this will be a <code>WKInterfaceTable</code> with a custom <code>TableRowController</code>, holding a <code>WKInterfaceImage</code> and a <code>WKInterfaceLabel</code>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-03-29/storyboard.png" width="600" height="260" title="&lsquo;WatchKit storyboard&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The custom <code>TableRowController</code> is a plain class with a couple of properties, so let&rsquo;s take a look at this first:</p>

<pre><code>class EntryTableRowController: NSObject {
    @IBOutlet var imageCheck: WKInterfaceImage!
    @IBOutlet var textLabel: WKInterfaceLabel!
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty straightforward, think of it as the equivalent of a custom <code>UITableViewCell</code>.<br/>
Let&rsquo;s take a look on how to populate the table:</p>

<pre><code>override func awakeWithContext(context: AnyObject?) {
    super.awakeWithContext(context)

    let directory: NSURL = NSFileManager.defaultManager().containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier("group.it.fancypixel.Done")!
    let realmPath = directory.path!.stringByAppendingPathComponent("db.realm")
    RLMRealm.setDefaultRealmPath(realmPath)
    reloadTableData()
}

func reloadTableData() {
    let realm = RLMRealm.defaultRealm()
    let dataSource = Entry.allObjects()

    watchTable.setNumberOfRows(Int(dataSource.count), withRowType: "EntryRow")

    for index in 0..&lt;Int(dataSource.count) {
        let entry = dataSource[UInt(index)] as Entry
        if let row = watchTable.rowControllerAtIndex(index) as? EntryTableRowController {
            row.textLabel.setText(entry.title)
            let imageName = entry.completed ? "check-completed" : "check-empty"
            row.imageCheck.setImageNamed(imageName)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s a little different from what we&rsquo;re used in UIKit. No <code>delegate</code> nor <code>dataSource</code>, in WatchKit we explicitly define every row before showing the table.<br/>
Also, as you can see in the <code>awakeWithContext</code> function, we are setting up Realm as we did in the main app. As a side note, the pieces of code that are shared between the two targets (in our case, everything concerning the model) should be moved in a custom framework to avoid code duplication. For the purpose of this sample I opted to duplicate the Realm initialization and shared the model between the two targets, but in a more structured app I would definitely take the framework route.
If we build and run we can add an item on the phone, and once we reload the app we&rsquo;ll see the same item in the watch extension too.<br/>
That doesn&rsquo;t feel very responsive though, right? We&rsquo;ll fix that in a bit, but first let&rsquo;s add the ability to mark an item as <em>done</em> from the watch:</p>

<pre><code class="">override func table(table: WKInterfaceTable, didSelectRowAtIndex rowIndex: Int) {
    let dataSource = Entry.allObjects()
    let entry = dataSource[UInt(rowIndex)] as Entry
    let realm = RLMRealm.defaultRealm()
    realm.beginWriteTransaction()
    entry.completed = !entry.completed
    realm.commitWriteTransaction()
    reloadTableData()
}
</code></pre>

<p>That pretty much covers it. Right now it&rsquo;s even more apparent that even if the two apps are communicating, there&rsquo;s no real sense of interaction, since we need to reload the app to see the changes.</p>

<h1>Syncing data</h1>

<p>We need to somehow advertise that our watch app or our main app performed something meaningful. There are <em>official</em> ways to do that, and you can read more about them on <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/watchkit-open-ios-app-from-watch/">this blog post from Natasha The Robot</a>, but in this case I want to show you how a brilliant library called <a href="https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMWormhole">MMWormHole</a> can abstract this task for us.</p>

<h2>MMWormHole</h2>

<p>MMWormhole creates a bridge between an app and its extensions. The API is clear and concise and it has a delightfully geeky name. It works like a pub/sub system, one end registers its interest for a kind of message (defined by a string identifier), and the other end can broadcast a new event. When the event is raised the subscriber&rsquo;s handler is fired. Sounds like something we can leverage from our app. Let&rsquo;s start by registering interest in <code>watch</code> updates on our main app:</p>

<pre><code>self.wormhole.listenForMessageWithIdentifier("watchUpdate", listener: { (_) -&gt; Void in
    self.reloadEntries()
})
</code></pre>

<p>and on our watch app we&rsquo;ll listen for <code>main</code> updates:</p>

<pre><code>self.wormhole.listenForMessageWithIdentifier("mainUpdate", listener: { (_) -&gt; Void in
    self.reloadTableData()
})
</code></pre>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. When something changes in our model we just need to call these function:</p>

<pre><code>// From the watch
self.wormhole.passMessageObject("update", identifier: "watchUpdate")

// From the main app
self.wormhole.passMessageObject(someObject, identifier: "mainUpdate")
</code></pre>

<h1>Realm notifications</h1>

<p><em>Update</em></p>

<p>Once this post was live, Tim Anglade from Realm reached out to me and was kind enough to point out that there&rsquo;s a built-in notification system in Realm, so MMWormHole in this case isn&rsquo;t really needed. The API is really easy to use and requires no configuration, here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

<pre><code>realmToken = RLMRealm.defaultRealm().addNotificationBlock { note, realm in
    self.reloadEntries()
}
</code></pre>

<p>As long as we keep a strong pointer to the token, the system fires the notification block as soon as a write transaction is committed. You can find the updated code in the sample app.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the demo app in all of its glory:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-03-29/screenshot.gif" width="600" title="&lsquo;Done&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>As you can see it&rsquo;s really easy to bootstrap a simple app for WatchKit, and thanks to a couple of great open source libraries adding persistence and interactivity is a painless effort. A big <em>thank you</em> to both the Realm team and Mutual Mobile for the amazing work on MMWormHole.</p>

<p>As usual, you&rsquo;ll find the source code of the demo app on our <a href="https://github.com/FancyPixel/done-swift">GitHub page</a>. Feel free to leave a comment, we&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>
