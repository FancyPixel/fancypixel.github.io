We released a new app on the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gulps/id979057304?ls=1&mt=8) and decided to open source it. The app is called Gulps, a simple tracker of your daily water consumption. Gulps was a fun little side project built to learn a bit more about WatchKit and to strengthen my Swift-fu.  
If you read our latest post on [how to share data with Realm](http://fancypixel.github.io/blog/2015/03/29/share-data-between-watchkit-and-your-app-with-realm/), you'll find a lot of code in common in this app, but there's also quite a bit of new stuff that's worth checking out. For starters I personally really like the water meter that follows your device movement, made possible by the amazing [DPMeterView](https://github.com/dulaccc/DPMeterView). You might also like the Facebook Paper-like wavy effect in the onboarding, provided by one of my pride and joys, [AMWaveTransition](https://github.com/andreamazz/AMWaveTransition).  
You'll find the source [here](https://github.com/FancyPixel/gulps).  

Let us know what you think.  
Until next time.
